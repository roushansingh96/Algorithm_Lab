Algorithm Lab – Assignment 2

1. FILE is used for input and output by Bubble and Insertion Sort.

2. Input range taken are 5000, 10000, 15000, 2000 numbers.

3. ‘CPU time used’ by each sorting algorithm will be displayed on terminal.

4. Inputs are stored as :
                     “in_random5000.txt” for 5000 random numbers.
                     “in_ascending5000.txt” for 5000 ascending numbers.
                     “in_descending5000.txt” for 5000 descending numbers.

5. Output can be obtained as :

                     “./a.out   in_random5000.txt   out.random5000.txt”
