Algorithm Lab – Assignment 3

1. FILE is used for input and output.

2. Input ranges taken are 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000.

3. Number of comparisons and swaps are displayed as output on terminal.

4. Inputs are stored as :
                     “in_random5000.txt” for 5000 random numbers.
                     “in_duplicate5000.txt” for 5000 duplicate numbers.
                     “in_descending5000.txt” for 5000 descending numbers.

5. Output can be obtained as :

                     “./a.out   in_random5000.txt   out.random5000.txt”
